# The value of residential streets

I was particularly interested in this reading as it ties into what we're learning about in Land Use and Transportation: Urban Land Form. We're learning about how developers often have to shrink a parcel and give up part of their land to the street in order to contribute to slowly widening the street over time. This is not really efficient or useful for anyone in the long run but if anyone stands against it publicly, they're seen as siding with developers. It is frustrating to see how wide streets are both not useful for reducing congestion, but also reduce the land available for housing and therefore contribute to higher housing costs. The widening of streets are just accepted in the discipline as one of the only "easy" solutions to congestion even though it's been widely disproven. Making streets less wide also forces drivers to slow down which creates safer environments for pedestrians and cyclists. It's exciting to see in action how data can help inform policy decisions and have real world applications. One thing I keep being surprised by in this class is the accessibility of public data and the many ways it can be used to inform policy.
