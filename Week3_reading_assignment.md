# Response to the video of Geoff Boeing

I found this video a nice pairing to what I've been learning about in my Transportation and Land Use class. We've been discussing how land use and urban forms don't often change overtime. When land use was dictated long ago for a specific reason or another, even if that reason left (such as a street car network) the land use is fairly fixed. It's interesting how much of our lives are dictated by these archaic reasonings that no longer apply. This is also true, as Geoff mentions, for the legacies of red-lining and segregation in cities.
