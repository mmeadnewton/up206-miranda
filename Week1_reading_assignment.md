## Assignment 1
#### Prompt:
*This week's reading assignment is for you to find an article, blog, journal, chapter, or book that talks about data/information/knowledge/coding that includes some spatial component. Make sure it is something that you would like to share with the class. Then, write a paragraph (yes, a paragraph, not two) that summarizes the article. Write a second paragraph where you reflect critically and creatively about the material in your own words. Why did this article speak to you in regards to your approach to data and research? How does it inform you own data science goals?*

#### Article Summary
I read an article called [*Mapping transit‚Äêbased access: integrating GIS, routes and schedules*](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13658810902835404) by T. L. Lei & R. L. Church. The article discusses six different strategies for measuring accessibility and their respective mathematical definitions. The article then delves into the challenges of visually representing and understanding accessibility through a GIS. One challenge with mapping is that it can be hard to get data that is time-based rather than distance-based. Distance is often used as an imperfect proxy for time, and this has an effect on route planning. This is especially true for planning transit routes as it is hard to consider headways when distance is used as measure of the time a journey will take. The article presents the authors' own approach to analyzing accessibility taking these challenges into account and demonstrates their example by mapping the accesibility of Santa Barbara, CA. 

#### My Response
This piece is an interesting companion piece to what I've been reading in my other class on transportation and land use as well as to my research interests in this class. I have only just learned in class about accessibility and how it is definited and measured. I was curious to learn about how GIS is integrated into work on transit accessibility, and it was interesting to see real examples that synthesized transit mapping and GIS. However, the article is incredibly technical and definitely was beyond my full comprehension at times (especially in laying out exact formulas for calculating accessibility metrics). Also, the article is 10 years old and I have to wonder if some of their critiques of GIS's are still relevant. It occured to me that at least Google Maps has a really great transit and headway interface and so I would imagine that that sort of information could be aggregated for analysis using a GIS. They also point out the flaws in simply assessing accessibility by looking at individuals' distance to a transit station rather than taking into account the time it would take at those stations to reach major destinations. This is directly informative to what I was thinking about looking into for a final project, and this definitely has me thinking about how to improve a methodology regarding transit accessibility in my own research.
