# Assignment 1
### Prompt:
*This week's reading assignment is for you to find an article, blog, journal, chapter, or book that talks about data/information/knowledge/coding that includes some spatial component. Make sure it is something that you would like to share with the class. Then, write a paragraph (yes, a paragraph, not two) that summarizes the article. Write a second paragraph where you reflect critically and creatively about the material in your own words. Why did this article speak to you in regards to your approach to data and research? How does it inform you own data science goals?*


I read an article called *Mapping transit‚Äêbased access: integrating GIS, routes and schedules* by T. L. Lei & R. L. Church. 


My opinion:
This piece is an interesting companion piece to what I've been reading in my other class on transportation and land use. I was curious to learn about how GIS is integrated into work on transit accessibility.
