# Assignment 1
### Prompt:
*This week's reading assignment is for you to find an article, blog, journal, chapter, or book that talks about data/information/knowledge/coding that includes some spatial component. Make sure it is something that you would like to share with the class. Then, write a paragraph (yes, a paragraph, not two) that summarizes the article. Write a second paragraph where you reflect critically and creatively about the material in your own words. Why did this article speak to you in regards to your approach to data and research? How does it inform you own data science goals?*


I read an article called *Mapping transit‚Äêbased access: integrating GIS, routes and schedules* by T. L. Lei & R. L. Church. The article discusses different strategies for measuring the accessibility of a location and the challenges of visually representing and understanding accessibility through GIS. One challenge with this approach is that it can be hard to get data that is time-based rather than distance-based in a GIS system. Distance is often used as an imperfect proxy for time, and this has an affect on route planning. This is especially true for planning transit routes as it is hard to consider headways when distance is used as measure of the time a journey will take. 


My opinion:
This piece is an interesting companion piece to what I've been reading in my other class on transportation and land use. I was curious to learn about how GIS is integrated into work on transit accessibility, and it was interesting to see real examples that synthesized transit mapping and GIS. However, the article is incredibly technical and definitely was beyond my full comprehension at times (laying out exact formulas for calculating accessibility metrics). Also, the article is 10 years old and I have to wonder if some of their critiques of GIS systems now have work arounds. It occured to me that at least Google Maps has really great interfaces that show different transit routes and the time they would take in ways that at least are doable at an individual scale. They also point out the flaws in simply assessing accessibility by looking at distance to a bus stop because that does not take into account the time it would take to reach major destinations. This is directly informative to what I was thinking about looking at for a final project, so this definitely has me thinking about how to improve a methodology regarding transit accessibility.
